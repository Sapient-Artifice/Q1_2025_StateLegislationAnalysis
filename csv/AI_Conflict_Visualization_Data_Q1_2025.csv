Policy Topic,Conflict Risk,Federal Bills,State Bills,Actors Involved,Conflict Type,Conflict Summary
Deepfakes / Misinformation,High,2,46,"AK, CT, Congress",Disclosure standards vs. lack of federal law,"States like Alaska and Connecticut impose disclosure rules and campaign blackout periods for AI-generated political media, while Congress has introduced but not passed any uniform federal standard, creating a fragmented compliance landscape for platforms and campaigns."
Automated Hiring / Employment,Medium,1,35,"CA, NY, IL, Congress",Audit + notice rules differ; federal silence,"Several states now mandate audit trails and candidate notifications for AI hiring tools, but federal law is silent, forcing national employers to navigate divergent obligations depending on applicant location."
Healthcare & Pandemic Preparedness,Medium,3,12,"AZ, CA, AR, Congress",Federal push vs. state oversight limits,"Federal policy encourages AI use in pandemic response and healthcare innovation, while some states actively restrict AI-driven care decisions unless human oversight is present — raising the risk of implementation barriers for federally supported systems."
Generative AI & LLMs,High,1,8,"CA, IL, FL, Congress",Transparency + user warnings vary,"California requires disclosure of training data and Illinois mandates consumer warnings, but no federal law governs generative AI outputs or model transparency, leaving developers vulnerable to conflicting state obligations."
Algorithmic Discrimination,High,1,29,"HI, IL, MD, NY, Congress",Bias audit requirements vs. undefined federal standards,"States like Illinois and Hawaii enforce fairness audits and impact assessments for high-risk AI, yet the absence of a federal law defining discriminatory AI creates inconsistent protections and uncertainty for deployers."
Facial Recognition / Biometrics,High,0,22,"CO, MA, NY, IL",Consent vs. prohibition inconsistencies,"With some states banning facial recognition outright in schools and housing, and others allowing it with consent, the lack of a federal standard forces businesses and agencies to comply with contradictory biometric rules across jurisdictions."
Autonomous Systems / Vehicles,Medium,2,18,"ND, RI, CA, Congress",Surveillance + deployment fragmentation,"While states regulate drones, driverless cars, and police robots differently — some banning weaponized AI outright — Congress has yet to establish national operating standards, complicating interstate deployment."
AI Governance / Infrastructure,Low,5,8,"ND, AL, AK, Congress",Diverging task force strategies,"Both federal and state governments are building task forces and R&D support structures, but without a unifying framework, risk remains that state-level AI strategies diverge from national goals or standards."
AI in Schools / Curriculum,Low,0,21,"TN, IL, MS",Curriculum inconsistency; no federal requirement,"Some states require AI literacy in K–12 education, while others are silent, and the federal government provides only advisory guidance — resulting in uneven AI preparedness across the country’s school systems."
Robocalls / Communications,Medium,2,26,"OK, CA, FL, Congress",Impersonation bans vs. pending robocall rules,"States are moving fast to criminalize AI voice impersonation and grant publicity rights, while Congress debates rules on AI robocalls — leading to mixed enforcement landscapes and potential preemption issues."
Economic Regulation,Medium,1,14,"CA, CO, IL, AZ, Congress",Antitrust vs. proactive price algorithm bans,"States like California and Colorado are banning algorithmic price-fixing and rent-collusion tools, while the federal government still treats algorithmic collusion under legacy antitrust doctrine, risking enforcement inconsistency."
Workforce / Education,Low,2,35,"NY, CA, OH, GA, Congress",Upskilling focus differs by jurisdiction,"Most states and the federal government agree on funding and upskilling efforts for the AI workforce, though state-specific scholarship and training strategies may miss opportunities for national coordination."
Other / Emerging Uses,Medium,4,70,"AZ, CT, OK, CO, CA, Congress",Early bans + protections uneven across states,"States criminalize harmful or exploitative AI uses (e.g. CSAM, impersonation, addictive bots) ahead of federal action, leaving patchy protections and inconsistent rights depending on jurisdiction."
